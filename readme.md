# Tailwind Starter PRT

Not a PYT, "Pretty Young Thing" but a PRT... using Parcel, React, and TypeScript.

- Parcel: 1.12.4
- React: 17.0.1
- Typescript: 4.1.3
- Tailwind: 2.02

> Note:  Tailwind 2 is currently having some issues with PostCSS 8, so this uses the PostCSS 7 compatibility version for now.
